![Jekyll and Git]({{site.baseurl}}/images/jekandgit.png)

This is a blog about how this blog is built. This blog is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and published via [GithubPages](https://pages.github.com/). These are free and open-source tools that you can use to generate a website/blog. 

## Why would I want to use Jekyll and Github?
There are several advantages that come with using these tools, among which we can find the following:

- It is free. Like really free. The few additional costs are more related to software.
- **You own your code.** This, not only gives you full control over your blog and it's content. But also means you can move it's hosting, monetize it, use external tools and a lot more things without having to pay anybody to be able to do so.
- You will learn about the web and how it works. By doing a blog like this, you will learn a bit of HTML and CSS. This is the language of the internet and really useful to know. Even more, you will learn how to use tools like repositories and bundlers. This way you will understand to great detail what is going on with your blog and add or remove things you want or do not want. 

I will show you step by step how this blog has been made and you will be able to make a blog of your own. This guide will allow you to be as involved as you choose, from using a ready made template to which you need only to add information, to coding the entire website adding blog elements one by one.> We loved with a love that was more than love

This is obviously a way of building a blog for people interested in learning how to code. So if it sounds like you, make sure to you read the following posts.
